Answers to Intro to Complexity Assignment 

1. We can think of O(1) as taking a pile of garbage and dumping it into a trash can and we can think of O(2^n) as going through a pile of garbage, breaking each piece down and sorting each piece into a pile that represents its respective materials. 

2. The best case scenario for a binary search is that the first element in the list is the one we are looking for. 

3. The worse case scenario for a binary search is that the last element in the list is the one we are looking for. 

4. The bounded case scenario for a binary search represents the average between the best and worst case scenarios for the same binary search. 

5. (See graph in screenshot) 

6. The asymptotic limit (for the above graph) as n approaches infinity is infinity. 

7. The Big-ÎŸ for the graph above is ÎŸ(2^n) 

8. (See script) 

9. (See graph)  - (Note: both 8 and 9 are kinda absurdly simple silly and we talked about them so I hope this is okay)

10. The Big-ÎŸ for a binary search is ÎŸ(n) 

11. The Big-Î© for a binary search is Î©(1)

12. The Big-Î¸ for a binary search is Î¸(n/2)
